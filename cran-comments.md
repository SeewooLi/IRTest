## Resubmission
In this version I have:

* Made generic functions (i.e., `plot`, `print`, and `summary`) available.

* Conducted more thorough unit tests to enhance the stability of the functions.

  
## Test environments

* macOS 11.5.2 (release), R 4.2.1

* Ubuntu 20.04.4 (oldrel-1), R 4.1.3

* Ubuntu 20.04.4 (release), R 4.2.1
